# Red Team Perspective: Threat Modeling (Read-Only) üî¥

This section is for **understanding attacker methodologies**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** No exploitation steps or PoC code are included ‚Äî only conceptual threat modeling.

## Threat Landscape
- **Persistence:** Malware implanted in UEFI/BIOS or Intel ME.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting SMM vulnerabilities.
- **Supply Chain:** Compromised firmware updates.
- **Tampering:** SPI flash write attacks.

## Attacker Goals
- Survive OS reinstallations.
- Remain stealthy below the kernel.
- Control platform boot chain.
- Prevent defenders from restoring trust.

## Red-Team Value
- Identify weak configurations before adversaries.
- Model potential adversary capabilities.
- Help Blue Teams prioritize firmware defenses.
