## Security Controls
1. **UEFI Secure Boot** â†’ Only trusted bootloaders.
2. **Intel Boot Guard** â†’ CPU verifies BIOS authenticity.
3. **TPM Integration** â†’ Store and verify measurements.
4. **Firmware Update Policy** â†’ Use vendor-signed updates only.
5. **Monitoring Tools** â†’ Deploy Chipsec or vendor tools for integrity checking.

## Defensive Operations
